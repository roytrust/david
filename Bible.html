              <h4 class="a">Paul and Timothy, servants[a] of Christ Jesus,

                To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers[b] and deacons:[c]
                
                2 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</h4>
                <h4 class="b">3 I thank my God in all my remembrance of you, 4 always in every prayer of mine for you
                   all making my prayer with joy, 5 because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until
                    now. 6 And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at
                     the day of Jesus Christ. 7 It is right for me to feel this way about you all, because I hold you
                      in my heart, for you are all partakers with me of grace,[d] both in my imprisonment and in the
                       defense and confirmation of the gospel. 8 For God is my witness, how I yearn for you all with 
                       the affection of Christ Jesus. 9 And it is my prayer that your love may abound more and more,
                        with knowledge and all discernment, 10 so that you may approve what is excellent, and so be 
                        pure and blameless for the day of Christ, 11 filled with the fruit of righteousness that
                         comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.</h4>
                         <h4>12 I want you to know, brothers,[e] that what has happened to me has really served to
                            advance the gospel, 13 so that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard[f]
                             and to all the rest that my imprisonment is for Christ. 14 And most of the brothers,
                              having become confident in the Lord by my imprisonment, are much more bold to speak the
                               word[g] without fear.</h4>
